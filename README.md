# NewsPubPapers
Papers and pre-research useful for news publishers and authors

The aim of this repository is to hold papers and references that may be useful for generating a publication in the area of journalism and news authorship.

## Areas
Look into gaining a familiarity with the following areas:

 * Authorship aid tools, particularly for journalists
   - Maybe CAQDAS software/qualitative research tools?
 * Sentiment analysis --- applications and capabilities
 * Clustering of sentiment and topic
 * Filter bubble/social media agreement stuff
 
Bear in mind that we will have to have data to do anything, and our contribution should include some novel application of NLP methods.  Look for methods that can be updated with big data/ML techniques, and things where existing techniques can be generalised and turned into tools for journalists in-the-field, i.e. applied.

## Venues
We're looking to publish somewhere in the NLP world, or somewhere where journalism is the focus (methods and tools for journalists).  Aim for workshops or demo papers so we can discuss things with people.
