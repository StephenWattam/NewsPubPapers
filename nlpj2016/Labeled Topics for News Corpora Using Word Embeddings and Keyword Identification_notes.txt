Labeled Topics for News Corpora Using Word Embeddings and Keyword Identification

1. Using word embeddings and keyword extraction can create better temporal topics that are more coherent and informative than LDA and are also labelled.

They show how combining two NLP techniques can create labelled topics.

1. Find periods in the corpus
2. Pre process the text and find NER’s
3. Find NER’s that are statistically significant across the periods using frequency counts of the NERS in the periods
4. Run Word2Vec over the corpus
5. Using the Statistically significant NER’s as labels for topics find the most similar words using the Word2Vec model based on the NER word.

Looked at Donald Trump using Fox and National Public Radio using transcripts. The periods were monthly. 

They find that some of the NER labels are not informative enough and find that some topics needed combining.
